<h2><b>Bi fold, Tri Fold and Z Fold brochures for effective way to share information.</b></h2>
<div id="text">
<h4>A custom brochure, bi fold, tri fold or Z fold, is a marketing staple that gives you extra 
    room to tell your business story, present your prospects with products and services or simply 
    promote sales. Printing brochures online will aid you in telling a more complete story about your 
    company and what it can do, all by yourself. Compact and versatile, company brochures can be 
    distributed at events, sent as mailing inserts, used as corporate advertising material or 
    placed on office countertops. Different sizes help you get the right look for your project, 
    whether you’re creating a handout, takeaway or corporate presentation. What’s more, each 
    brochure is crisply folded before it’s shipped to you – meaning that you’re able to start 
    using them right away.</h4>
    <h4>Brochure printing was never this easy! With our online brochure maker, 
        explore our assortment of fully customisable designs, including options for 
        specific industries or events. Have your own design ready to go? Use our design 
        upload option. Once you’ve found a favourite design, make it yours by adding all 
        your key information and selecting the options that work best for you. Just place 
        your order online and we’ll take care of the rest, and your brochures will arrive 
        looking crisp, folded and ready to use.</h4>
